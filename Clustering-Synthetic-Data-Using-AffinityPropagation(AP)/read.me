## Assignment 4 - Data Mining

### Instructor: Dr. Mostafa Fakhrahmad

### Overview
This project involves generating synthetic datasets and implementing the Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering algorithm. The performance of AP is compared with other clustering methods like K-means and HDBSCAN.

### Datasets
The synthetic datasets are generated using `scikit-learn` functions:
- `make_circles`: Creates concentric circle clusters.
- `make_moons`: Generates two crescent-shaped clusters.
- `make_blobs`: Produces Gaussian-distributed clusters with predefined centers.

These datasets are artificially generated and do not contain any proprietary or sensitive data. Therefore, sharing them publicly does not pose any legal concerns.

### Implementation
1. **Data Synthesis**: Three datasets are generated with predefined parameters.
2. **Data Exploration**: Scatter plots are used to visualize the datasets.
3. **Clustering Algorithm**: AP is implemented from scratch without using pre-built library functions.
4. **Hyperparameter Selection**: Different hyperparameters are tested to optimize clustering performance.
5. **Evaluation**: Clustering quality is assessed using multiple evaluation metrics.
6. **Comparison**: Results of AP clustering are compared with K-means and HDBSCAN.

### Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn hdbscan
```

### Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (`code.ipynb`) to generate datasets, perform clustering, and visualize results.
