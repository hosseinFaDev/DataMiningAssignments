# Data Mining Assignments Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of university assignments for the **Data Mining** course. Each assignment covers different aspects of data mining techniques, including data exploration, association rule mining, and classification.

## Assignments
### 1. **Getting to Know Your Data**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Iris dataset**
- Statistical analysis and correlation computation
- Data visualization techniques

### 2. **Association Rule Mining Using FP-Growth**
- Preprocessing the **Adult Census Income dataset**
- Implementing **FP-Growth** from scratch
- Generating and evaluating association rules

### 3. **Classifying Fashion MNIST Images Using KNN**
- Implementing **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** from scratch
- Feature scaling and dimensionality reduction with PCA
- Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation

### 4. **Clustering Synthetic Data Using Affinity Propagation**
- Generating synthetic datasets using make_circles, make_moons, and make_blobs
- Implementing **Affinity Propagation (AP) clustering** from scratch
- Comparing AP with K-means and HDBSCAN
- Evaluating clustering performance with multiple metrics
- Visualizing results with scatter plots

## How to Use
Each assignment has its own directory containing:
- **Source Code** (Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks)
- **Dataset (if applicable)** â€“ Not included in the repository for licensing reasons

### Running the Code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hosseinfadev/DataMiningAssignments.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the relevant assignment directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Assignment Name" 
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the scripts or Jupyter notebooks as per the instructions in each `README.md`.
