# Data Mining - Homework 2

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for **Data Mining Assignment 2: Association Rule Mining Using FP-Growth**. The assignment focuses on mining association rules from the **Adult Census Income dataset** by applying preprocessing steps and implementing the **FP-Growth algorithm** from scratch.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Analyzing the dataset structure and handling missing values.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Missing value imputation
  - Merging infrequent categories
  - Binarizing categorical attributes
  - Discretizing and binarizing continuous attributes
- **Association Rule Mining**:
  - Implementing FP-Growth to find frequent itemsets
  - Generating association rules based on a confidence threshold

## Dataset
The **Adult Census Income dataset** is a publicly available dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**:
- **Source**: [UCI Repository - Adult Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult)
- **Description**: It contains demographic information about individuals, along with an income label (<=50K or >50K).
- **Note**: To avoid unnecessary data exposure, it is recommended **not to include the dataset file (`adult.csv`) in the public repository**. Instead, users can download it from the official source.

```
- **`src/`**: Contains Python scripts for exploration, preprocessing, and association analysis.
- **`dist/`**: Stores output files, including the preprocessed dataset, frequent itemsets, and association rules.
- **`data/`**: (Optional) Contains the original dataset file, but it should **not** be uploaded to a public repository.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists required Python libraries.


## Usage
### Data Exploration
Run the exploration script to analyze the dataset:
```bash
python src/explore.py
```

### Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to clean and transform the dataset:
```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```
- The processed dataset will be saved as `dist/adult_preprocessed.csv`.

### Association Rule Mining
Run the association analysis script to generate frequent itemsets and rules:
```bash
python src/association_analysis.py
```
- Frequent itemsets will be saved in `dist/freq_itemsets.txt`.
- Generated association rules will be saved in `dist/rules.txt`.
